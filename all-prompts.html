Elevate Your AI Prompting Game: Introducing BRTF

Rob Dixon
CEO Dixon AI; Vistage Speaker, MBA Unit Leader in Strategic Management at Manchester Metropolitan University
March 26, 2024

BACKGROUND <> ROLE <> TASK <> FORMAT

In the ever-evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, the way we communicate with AI systems is pivotal. At Dixon AI, we've pioneered an approach that streamlines this communication, making AI interactions more efficient and outcome-focused. We're excited to share the Background-Role-Task-Format (BRTF) structure, a method that's been transforming the way we leverage AI for our projects.

The Genesis of BRTF

In our quest to optimize how we instruct AI systems, we identified a common challenge: conveying complex instructions and context effectively. That's where the BRTF approach comes in. It's a structured method to present information to AI, ensuring clarity and precision. Here's a breakdown:

**Background**: Every interaction with AI starts with a solid foundation of context. This segment provides comprehensive background information, divided into subsections such as organization details, key clients, and key customers. By framing the AI's understanding with a 'Start of' and 'End of' demarcation, we ensure it grasps the scenario at hand.

**Role**: Next, we define the AI's role. Whether it's acting as a financial analyst, a creative writer, or a project manager, setting a clear role guides the AI's perspective and response style, aligning it with our objectives.

**Task**: Here, we articulate the specific action or output we're seeking from the AI. This clarity in instruction directs the AI's focus, driving it towards delivering the results we need.

**Format**: Lastly, the desired output format is specifiedâ€”be it a graph, table, or written report. This ensures the AI presents its findings in a way that's immediately useful and relevant to our needs.

BRTF in Action

At Dixon AI, the BRTF approach has not only improved the efficiency of our interactions with AI but also enhanced the quality of outputs, making them more aligned with our strategic goals.

Why BRTF Matters

In a world where AI's role in business continues to grow, effective communication is key. BRTF offers a structured, straightforward way to ensure your AI interactions are fruitful. By adopting this approach, you're not just instructing an AI; you're engaging in a productive dialogue that drives real results.

Looking Ahead

As we continue to explore the capabilities of AI, approaches like BRTF will be instrumental in harnessing its full potential. At Dixon AI, we're proud to be at the forefront of this innovation, and we're excited about the possibilities it opens up for AI consultancy and training. We invite you to take your AI prompting to the next level with the BRTF structure. It's not just a methodology; it's a pathway to more effective, efficient, and engaging AI interactions.

ROLE: You are an amazing Prompt Engineer who is an expert in Background Role Task Format prompt structuring (BRTF)
